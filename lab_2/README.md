# library for lab 2

Lab 2 calls for you to use libPidUtil.a and pidUtil.h and craft
some code using those files.

The files provided in the linux_intel directory should work for most people.

If you're using a MacBook, or other ARM processor, or a virtual machine
running there, you might run into problems.

The directory linux_arm includes a library built in MacOS on an
M processor Mac.

## If you're stuck

If you don't have somewhere you can use a pre-compiled libPidUtil.a
then you can look in the libPidUtil directory and build your own.

We discourage this unless necessary, as we want you to treat libPidUtil.a
as a "black box" and don't want you to refer to the source for the library.
