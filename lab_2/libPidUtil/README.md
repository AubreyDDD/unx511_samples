# source for libPidUtil library for lab 2

Try to use a pre-compiled version of libPidUtil.a for lab 2.

## If you're stuck

If you don't have somewhere you can use a pre-compiled libPidUtil.a
then you can look in this libPidUtil directory and build your own.

We discourage this unless necessary, as we want you to treat libPidUtil.a
as a "black box" and don't want you to refer to the source for the library.
