# $@ is the name of the file being generated (the target),
# and $< the first prerequisite (usually the source file),
# and $^ all of the prerequisites.
# For example, consider the following declaration:
# 
# all: library.cpp main.cpp
#
# In this case:
#     $@ evaluates to all
#     $< evaluates to library.cpp
#     $^ evaluates to library.cpp main.cpp
#

# The % signs indicate a pattern matching, so this means that
# thing.o depends on thing.c and whatever $(DEPS) expands to
%.o: %.c $(DEPS)

# In this case, $^ expands to $(OBJ), whatever that is
hellomake: $(OBJ)
