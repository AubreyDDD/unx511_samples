# More About Makefiles

These Makefiles are based on the examples at

https://www.cs.colby.edu/maxwell/courses/tutorials/maketutor/

They all compile the same code, but demonstrate different
features of Makefiles.

You can try them out using the -n (no action, dry run) and
-f options to make e.g.
```
make -n -f Makefile1
```

Read the comments in the different Makefiles.

Remember that command actions must be indented with a tab character,
not spaces.
